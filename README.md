# Spam-Classifier

This is an implementation of the Naive Bayes Classification technique as a Spam Classifier.    
Coded from the scratch in Python.

Each version has it's own branch.   
Master is the latest version. (And possibly under development.)    

_Working on making this project more generic._

- Currently classification works in the specified set of mails.
- Modularised source code into separate files.
- Removed hard coded paths. (config.txt)

## Version: V01_01:
- Single script for preprocessing, training, testing. 
- Simple implementation I did as a part of class project during my masters degree.
